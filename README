This is a suite of tools for processing teletext signals recorded on VHS, as
well as tools for processing teletext packet streams. The software has only
been tested with bt8x8 capture hardware, but should work with any VBI capture
hardware if you write a new configuration file (see config_bt8x8_pal.py).


INSTALLATION
------------

In order to use CUDA decoding you need to use the Nvidia proprietary driver.

Install python dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pycuda
    pip install --user scikit-cuda

You can use setup.py to install, or just add the source directory to your
path.


USAGE
-----

First capture VBI from VHS:

    vbicat /dev/vbi0 > capture.vbi

Scan for headers in the capture:

    deconvolve -H -S 20 capture.vbi > headers.txt

Examine the headers to find services on the tape:

    less -r headers.txt

Deconvolve a section of the capture corresponding to one service:

    deconvolve --start <N> --stop <N> capture.vbi > service.t42

Extract a page from the result:

    t42pipe service.t42 -PS -p 100
