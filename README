Step 1 - Capture teletext packets

Compile dumpvbi:

	gcc -o dumpvbi dumpvbi.c

Create a folder for captures:

	mkdir cap0001
	cd cap0001

Do capture:

	../dumpvbi

This produces raw binary files starting at 00000000.vbi. Each file contains 32 
vbi lines sampled from a single frame. Each line is 2048 samples.

Step 2 - Run recovery

Run vbi.py on the sampled data:

	../vbi.py . > output

Step 3 - Run hamming distance correlation (optional)

Run distance.py on the output from vbi.py:

	../distance.py output > output1

Step 4 - View results

Run the output through demux.py and printit.py:

	cat output1 | ../demux.py 1 | ../printit.py

This will print all the packets from magazine 1 to the terminal. You can also
generate html pages instead (you need the teletext2.ttf to view them):

	cat output1 | ../demux.py 1 | ../printit.py h > 100.html
